Game Demo for a 3rd Person game

Intructions:
You will have to run the game through GoDot as i have not put it on anyplatform as of yet.
you have got to make your way through the maze that has been built and reach the house.

The controls are listed below.

Controls :
W - Move forward
S - Move Backward
A - Move left
D - move right 
Shift - Run

Features:
I struggled to add a puzzle elment so I treid to build a maze
I also had issues emplimenting a ineractive element as it would not work the door to the house at the end of the maze is supposed to open but through mutiple atempts i could not get it to work.

I faced a misive issue half through the project i had a power outage and lost most of my work. so i wasnt able to add some of the other features i would have liked, for exmple fighting machanics.
I did however manage to rebuild a demo for you its not as perfect as i would like it to be.

Another challenge a faced is working with github, I have never used it before this project and it was an intersting learning expierance.

This was my firdt project i made with 3d graphics and models so it was interesting to learn the code and difrenet ways of emplementing collision boxes and animations.
